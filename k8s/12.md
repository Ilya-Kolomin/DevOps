# Theory

StatefulSet - manager of deployment and scaling of pods. Its main feature that it persist state of the set of pods in some storage.

HeadlessService - a service without assigned `clusterIP` field. So that it is not managed by kube gateway or proxy and thus not load-balanced or DNS configured. This may be used if you are not fulfilled with the kube DNS and proxy management.

PersistentVolumes - just volume to store some data. It is a resource like a node, but its lifecycle is independent of the associated pod.

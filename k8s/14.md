## Theory

* Prometheus operator - operator/manager for other components 
* Prometheus - actual metrics collector, monitors pods and generates alerts for alert-manager
* Alertmanager - manages alerts, pass them from prometheus to other alert services (email, messengers, other).
* Prometheus node-exporter - module that is installed inside pods. Collects information, such as resources usage and exports them to prometheus.
* Grafana - UI visualisation of obtained data. Human-readable dashboards could be created here.
